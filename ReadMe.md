#BLACK JACK
This is a computerized version of the game of blackjack between a single player and a dealer. The game allows the player to play a single deck game of black jack. It allows the player to pick a betting amount with buttons and then starting the game. 

It plays like a regular game of blackjack with the exceptions of the split rule and does not allow for the practice of card counting as the is reconstructed and shuffled after each hand.

#Getting Started
 /// deployed game link goes here /// 

The game disables buttons that should not be used. Click the buttons labled with Money icons to decide how much you would like to bet. 
Once you have decided how much you would like to wagar click the "DEAL" button and the game starts. After receiving your hand you can choose to double down, hit, or stay. After which the dealer then plays scores are calculated and winnings are distributed.
Once the game ends you can choose to play another round either until you get bored or run out of funds.

#Next Steps
Given more time I would like to more closely imitate the way blackjack is played in real life. Adding the split feature as well as maintaining the deck until it gets low before reshuffling the cards.
Things I would like to add.
- animations: dealer's face down card turning over, cards being delt from a deck.
  discard pile on the side of the board.

- sound:Sounds for cards being delt, maybe sounds for winning and losing or
  background noises similar to what you would find at a casino.

- complexity: Leaving the same deck for multiple hands so that someone who knows
  how to count cards is able to, also the ability to select how many decks are being played with as that creates different odds. 

- mutltiplayer capability: possibly add networking to let people play aginst each   
  other
